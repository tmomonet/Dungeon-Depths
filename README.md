# Dungeon-Depths

Deranged Depths

Abstract:

In Deranged Depths, players will descend into the twisting demesnes of dank dungeons. In hopes of achieving feats of glory, acquiring powerful artifacts, and accumulating untold riches, characters will risk life and limb. The untold horrors of each dungeon depend on the terrain which the heroes choose to explore. 

Sojourn the depths using pre-generated characters or choose talents from 5 class trees. Combine spell and sword to devastating effect, build a ranged sniper rogue, with 4,000+ combinations, customization is simple yet profound.
